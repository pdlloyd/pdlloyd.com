Hello! My name is Patrick and welcome to my pubic home on the internet. I'm originally from Florida but now live in the SF Bay Area in California. I have a degree in electrical engineering ([Go Gators](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/)), but my professional and personal interests are extremely broad.

Some of my hobbies include gardening & composting, [distributed computing](https://clusterfights.com/), rock climbing, embedded systems, self-hosting personal cloud services, and playing with my pets (cats MOSFET and Hashbrown, and dog Taco). 

I also run a security company called [Jacana.io](https://jacana.io) that focuses on finding exploits in hardware and software and disclosing them responsibly.

You can get in contact with me via email at {my first name} {at} {[this domain](/)}.
