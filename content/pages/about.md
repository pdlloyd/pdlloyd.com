Hello! My name is Patrick and welcome to my pubic home on the internet. I'm originally from Florida but now live in the SF Bay Area in California. I have a degree in electrical engineering ([Go Gators](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/)), but my professional and personal interests are extremely broad.

Some of my hobbies include gardening & composting, [distributed computing](https://clusterfights.com/), rock climbing, embedded systems, self-hosting personal cloud services, and playing with my pets (cats MOSFET and Hashbrown, and dog Taco). 

You can get in contact with me most places via my handle `@pdlloyd`:
