Hello! My name is Patrick and this site is the root of my public presence on the internet. I'm originally from Florida but now live in the SF Bay Area in California. I have a degree in electrical engineering ([Go Gators!](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/)), but professionally I write software for embedded systems.

Some of my hobbies include composting, growing mushrooms (the food kind), [distributed computing](https://clusterfights.com/), rock climbing, self-hosting personal cloud services, movies, and playing with my pets (cats MOSFET and Hashbrown, and dog Taco).

You can get in contact with me most places via my handle `@pdlloyd`:
